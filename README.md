# ResilienceBasins

This is the Julia code used for the article "Resilience basins of complex systems: An application to prosumer impacts on power grids" (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0120891).

The article can also be found on the arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09474

Some of the code is in raw Julia script (.jl) format for importing and execution on a cluster, some is in Jupyter Notebook form for better readability and interactive plotting (the latter requiring certain packages and extensions).
